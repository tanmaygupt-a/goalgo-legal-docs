    <h1>GoAlgo – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: 06 June 2025</p>
    <p class="date"><strong>Version:</strong> 3.5</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to the GoAlgo application, operated by Young Engineers Holdings Ltd. ("we", "our", or "us"). GoAlgo is designed to help students and instructors engage with graphical programming using AI-assisted tools. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information within the app. By using GoAlgo, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>At this time, GoAlgo does not collect any personal data. However, we do collect anonymous technical and interaction data as part of the application's operation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Chat Input:</strong> Anonymous voice, text, or image input sent to third-party AI services (e.g., OpenAI) for processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Activity Logs:</strong> Anonymous usage data tied to device/session ID, such as time spent on coding tasks or steps completed.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Metadata:</strong> Non-identifiable information (e.g., device type, operating system) to improve functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> While no personal data is collected, input data (including images and voice) may be temporarily stored by third-party AI providers under their own privacy terms.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use This Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable AI-based code generation features.</li>
      <li>Improve app performance and educational outcomes.</li>
      <li>Analyze anonymous user engagement.</li>
      <li>Monitor usage for research and feature development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>GoAlgo integrates third-party services to process AI inputs. These may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenAI (ChatGPT or equivalent) for AI responses.</li>
      <li>Cloud platforms (e.g., AWS or similar) for managing user session and login data (if added in the future).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All third-party services are required to comply with applicable data protection laws such as GDPR.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Login for franchisees and instructors is secured through Young Engineers’ Microsoft login with 2FA.</li>
      <li>Data transmission is encrypted where applicable.</li>
      <li>Student/instructor activity logs are accessible only to HQ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GoAlgo does not maintain a local or centralized personal database.</li>
      <li>Activity logs are stored in the cloud and linked only to device/session IDs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GoAlgo is used by children, but we do not collect identifiable information about them.</li>
      <li>Caregiver consent is not required because no personal data is collected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no identifiable information to access, correct, or delete. However, any future changes in functionality involving personal data collection will be accompanied by an updated Privacy Policy and appropriate consent mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>8. Ownership</h2>
    <p>All content, models, and instructions within GoAlgo are the intellectual property of Young Engineers Holdings Ltd.</p>
